# React-ToDoList
Created with CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/amazing-dhawan-gdnv0?file=/src/ToDoList.js)

My first React application that I built out of my own imagination. Used hooks, learned the fundamentals of how to use state, props, passing state as props, components, array destructuring, inline styling, array manipulation, and more

Features include: 
1. User defined todo items, creates new components with todo item upon clicking enter
2. able to click on the item to gray out/strikeout text
3. ability to delete todo items

Features to be added: 
1. ability to edit todo items 
2. ability to re order todo items using drag feature
